In this library, matrices are represented by two-dimensional jagged arrays, with support for integer (32-bit), float, double, complex and decimal elements.
Some features include basic operations such as matrix multiplication and exponentiation, entrywise operations like matrix addition, subtraction, division and product (Hadamart product), as well as solving systems of linear equations, transposition, matrix determinant, matrix rank, inner product, matrix norms, decomposition by LU and QR methods, among others.
Parallel execution versions of most functions also available.
To see how it works, please run the test program and see the code.
